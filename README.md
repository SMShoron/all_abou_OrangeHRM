# all_about_OrangeHRM

Project Description: 

Automation Framework: Selenium 
Programming Language: Java 
Build Tool: Maven 
Java Version: 1.8

Notes: 
1. API Documentation Link: https://orangehrm.github.io/orangehrm-api-doc/
2. As OrangeHRM is using OAuth as authentication, we need to create a client through the Admin panel. Please note that the client will be created temporarily. Thatâ€™s why make sure, the client is already created, if not, please create one by going to this URL: https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/index.php/admin/registerOAuthClient Use this client Info which I used in the postman collection: 
    ID: webtest 
    Secret: webtest123
After creating the client, you may try running my postman collection.
